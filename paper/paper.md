# Summary

In 2012, we present a software (EthoWatcher) developed to support ethography, object tracking and extraction of kinematic variables from digital video files of lab animals. Most of the presently available systems focuses either on direct behavior recording or on automatic activity/tracking analysis [@spink2001ethovision] [@lind2005validation] and they had improved the prospects for a higher inter-experiment and inter-laboratory standardization, reliability and replicability of the data derived from these different approaches. However, electing one approach to the exclusion of the other may lead to incomplete descriptions of the behaviors. The simultaneous and combined use of ethological methods (using discrete behavioral categories) and automatic methods of behavioral recording (describing continuous, kinematically-derived variables) on the same data set can complement each other to provide additional insight on the structure of experimentally induced changes in animal behavior (20). 

We herein present the EthoWatcher®, a digital video-based system that allow for automatic activity/tracking analysis and for catalogue-based behavioral recording functions, permitting a fine-grained (frame-by-frame resolution) integration of these data sets. We also present the procedures used to validate the measurements carried out by the software, as well as a case study using its tools to analyze a simple set of behavioral pharmacology data (the behavioral effects of systemic caffeine injections in the rat). The “EthoWatcher®” is registered in the Brazilian National Intellectual Property Institute (INPI) on the protocol number 09285-3, electronic journal No. 1982 and is freely available for non-commercial purposes (downloadable at the www.ethowatcher.ufsc.br).
