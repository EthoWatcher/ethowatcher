# Download

The EthoWatcher [was developed](/about) was a free software and DOES NOT need to be installed. Just [download here the last version](/download/EthoWatcherOS_beta_48_5.rar) and place EthoWacher® in any folder you want. We recommend that you save EthoWatcher in a folder inside Documents or in the Desktop, and double-click on the .EXE file to run. We sugested to avoid [some know problems](/discussion) to create a folder named ethowatcher in root of computer folder (e.g., C:/EthoWatcher) and put all video files, etographics files, analysis files in that folder.

If you used this software, and found it useful to your research, we ask you to kindly cite the related paper, which describes in further details the validation and calibration procedures of the EthoWatcher®

PAPER



# Software needs to run

To correctly play video files acquired from different cameras, even if already in AVI file format, you will probably need to install a pack of video codecs (e.g.: XVID MPEG codec), because most of the codecs used in webcams and camcorders are not present in Windows® default configuration. To play them in Windows Media Player® and in EthoWatcher®, we used (and recommend) to install  [K-Lite Mega Codec Pack](https://k-lite-mega-codec-pack.br.uptodown.com/windows/download) to correct open your videos. It installs the most common video codecs.

# Get a sample to get starting to work

To work with  EthoWatcher® OS you will need behavioral videos. We have some tutorials to instruct how to film a proprety film. But for starting learning how to use EthoWatcher® OS you can get a free:

- [sample of a clock video ](/assets/test_video.avi)
- [sample of a isopor sphere video](/assets/bola_grande.avi)

The EthoWatcher® has some limitations in open up videos, lean more.
